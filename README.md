The arguments passed to the program consist of flags and values. 
Flags should be one character, preceded by a minus sign. Each 
flag should have zero, or one value associated with it.

You should write a parser for this kind of arguments. This parser 
takes a schema detailing what arguments the program expects. 
The schema specifies the number and types of flags and values 
the program expects. For example, the schema `l,p#,d*` defines three 
command-line arguments: `â€“l` is a Boolean argument, `-p` is an integer 
argument, and `-d` is a string argument. 

Once the schema has been specified, the program should pass 
the actual argument list to the args parser. It will verify that 
the arguments match the schema. The program can then ask the args 
parser for each of the values, using the names of the flags. 
The values are returned with the correct types, as specified in the schema.

For example, if the program is to be called with these arguments:
```
-l -p 8080 -d /usr/logs
```
this indicates a schema with 3 flags: `l`, `p`, `d`. The `l` (logging) flag 
has no values associated with it, it is a boolean flag, `true` if present, 
`false` if not. the `p` (port) flag has an integer value, and the `d` 
(directory) flag has a string value.

If a flag mentioned in the schema is missing in the arguments, a suitable 
default value should be returned. For example `false` for a boolean, `0` for 
a number, and `""` for a string. If the arguments given do not match the schema, 
it is important that a good error message is given, explaining exactly what 
is wrong.

Here is an example use case:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  try {
    Args arg = new Args("l,p#,d*", args);
    boolean logging = arg.getBoolean('l');
    int port = arg.getInt('p');
    String directory = arg.getString('d');
    executeApplication(logging, port, directory);
  } catch (ArgsException e) {
    System.out.printf("Argument error: %s\n", e.errorMessage());
  }
}
```
If you are feeling ambitious, extend your code to support lists, eg.
```
-g this,is,a,list -d 1,2,-3,5
```

So the `g` flag indicates a list of strings, `["this", "is", "a", "list"]` and 
the `d` flag indicates a list of integers, `[1, 2, -3, 5]`.

Make sure your code is extensible, in that it is straightforward and obvious 
how to add new types of values.

# Test
Download [junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone/1.9.0/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.0.jar), which includes JUnit5, and put it in your project root directory.

Compile the test with the following command:
```
javac -cp .:junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.0.jar ArgsTest.java
```

Run the test with the following command:
```
java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.0.jar --class-path . --select-class ArgsTest
```

## Suggested Test Cases
* make sure you have a test with a negative integer (confusing `-` sign)
* the order of the arguments need not match the order given in the schema.
* have some tests that suitable default values are correctly assigned if flags 
given in the schema are missing in the args given.
